# ⚠️ URGENT: API KEY SECURITY NOTICE

## 🚨 CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

GitHub has detected that your Claude API key was exposed in the deployment guide. This has been **FIXED** in all files now, but you need to take action immediately.

---

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE STEPS (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Revoke Your Current API Key (5 minutes)

Your exposed key starts with: `sk-ant-api03-uyb7p...`

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Log in to your Anthropic account
3. Navigate to **"API Keys"**
4. Find the key starting with `sk-ant-api03-uyb7p...`
5. Click **"Delete"** or **"Revoke"**
6. Confirm deletion

**Why?** The key was briefly visible in your GitHub repository and should be considered compromised.

### Step 2: Generate a New API Key (2 minutes)

1. Still in https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Give it a name: "Rapha Lumina Website"
4. Copy the new key immediately
5. Save it securely in:
   - Your password manager (recommended), OR
   - A secure note on your computer, OR
   - The Word document (keep it private!)

### Step 3: Update Your Repository (If Uploaded to GitHub)

**Option A: Start Fresh (Easiest)**
1. Delete your GitHub repository
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload the corrected files (from outputs folder)
4. The corrected files no longer contain the API key

**Option B: If You Haven't Pushed to GitHub Yet**
- Great! Just use the corrected files from your outputs folder
- The API key has been removed from all files

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

I've removed your API key from:
- ✅ deployment-guide.md
- ✅ js/main.js (now uses environment variables)
- ✅ All documentation files

I've added:
- ✅ .gitignore file (protects sensitive files)
- ✅ .env.example (template for local testing)
- ✅ SECURITY.md (complete security guide)
- ✅ Proper environment variable setup in code

---

## 🔒 How It Works Now (Secure Method)

### In Production (DigitalOcean):
1. Your API key is stored as an **encrypted environment variable** in DigitalOcean
2. The JavaScript code reads it from `process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY`
3. The key is NEVER in your code files
4. GitHub never sees your API key

### Setup Process:
1. Upload code to GitHub (no API key in files)
2. Deploy to DigitalOcean
3. Add API key in DigitalOcean Settings → Environment Variables
4. Done! Chatbot works securely

---

## 📋 Updated Deployment Process

Follow these steps **after** revoking and regenerating your API key:

1. **GitHub Upload:**
   - Use the files from your `/outputs/` folder
   - They no longer contain your API key ✅
   
2. **DigitalOcean Setup:**
   - Create your app
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `CLAUDE_API_KEY` = [your NEW api key]
   - Make sure "Encrypt" is checked ✅
   
3. **Deploy:**
   - DigitalOcean will deploy
   - Chatbot will work using the encrypted environment variable
   - Your API key remains secure

---

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Old API key revoked in Anthropic console
- [ ] New API key generated and saved securely
- [ ] Files in `/outputs/` folder do NOT contain API key
- [ ] `.gitignore` file is in place
- [ ] Plan to add API key as environment variable in DigitalOcean
- [ ] Verified: No `sk-ant-api` text in any files going to GitHub

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

**API keys are like passwords.** If exposed:
- ❌ Anyone can use your Claude API
- ❌ You get charged for their usage
- ❌ They could exhaust your API limits
- ❌ Your data could be accessed

**Environment variables keep keys secure** because:
- ✅ Never stored in code
- ✅ Not visible in GitHub
- ✅ Encrypted in DigitalOcean
- ✅ Easy to rotate/update

## 🎯 Quick Action Summary

**Right Now (5 minutes):**
1. Revoke old API key at https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Generate new API key
3. Save new key securely

**When Deploying (later):**
1. Use corrected files from `/outputs/` folder
2. Upload to GitHub (no API key in files)
3. Add new API key as environment variable in DigitalOcean
4. Deploy and test!

## 📝 Final Note

This was caught by GitHub's security scanning - which is actually good! It means the security systems are working. Now that you know how to handle API keys properly, you'll never have this issue again.

**Your website will be secure, and your API key will be protected!** 🔒✨

**Action Item:** Revoke the old key and generate a new one now, then proceed with deployment using the secure method outlined in SECURITY.md

You've got this! 💪🌟
